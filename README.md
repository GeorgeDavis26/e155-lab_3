# E155 Lab 3

Keypad Scanner

This lab focuses on implementing A keypad scanner and the same time time-multiplexing scheme to drive two seven-segment displays with a single set of FPGA I/O pins used in lab 2. Building a simple pnp transistor circuit to drive large currents from the FPGA pins and Modular verilog architecture.
